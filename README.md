  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div align="center">

### 👋 Hello World! I'm Juancho

</div>

Hello everyone, my name is 𝓙𝓾𝓪𝓷 𝓒𝓪𝓻𝓵𝓸𝓼, affectionately called 𝓙𝓾𝓪𝓷𝓬𝓱𝓸. I was born and raised in a small countryside town dedicated to **☕ specialty coffee production** in Colombia. My parents are from the countryside and dedicate themselves to producing **specialty coffee** - I grew up in the countryside and it's something I'm deeply **proud of**. I love coffee, and it's curious how almost all developers seem to share this same passion! 

I started programming and fell in love with this industry a few years ago. Like everyone starting in the world of software development, there are countless paths to choose from. Initially, I wanted to dedicate myself to **🔐 cybersecurity**, but gradually I found my calling in **🌐 web development** and, more broadly, developing applications and services that can be deployed on **☁️ cloud infrastructure**. 

Beyond coding, I love to **📚 read** and **🎵 listen to music**. I believe in being **💯 honest** and **🤝 helping others**. I have several projects and ambitious goals that I'm determined to achieve. I hope you enjoy my work - I always strive to be **📐 organized and methodical** in everything I do, from life to code.

<div align="center">

### 🐧 Linux Enthusiast & Lifelong Learner

</div>

I'm a **Linux enthusiast** - it was my first approach to software development, so I have a lot of affection for it (I generally use **Arch Linux with GNOME** 🖥️).

If there's something I didn't mention, it's that I **love learning**. I'm a learning enthusiast, and I'm not just talking about learning new technologies or programming languages, but learning everything that life can offer me 🌟.

Related to my learning is that I also **love teaching**. I was educated in one of the best public schools in Santander, Colombia, which is also pedagogical. This made me like teaching and doing it correctly and clearly 👨‍🏫.

I like to **solve problems**, understand them, and try to find a solution. Everything has a why and what for, and personally, it's something I like to do, although sometimes not so much 🧩.

I try to be **organized and pragmatic** with my life, and this covers almost everything, even the way I write code. I try to apply almost everything that can help me as a developer 💻.

  <h1>Current Goals</h1>
</div>

## 🎯 Professional Goals

- 🔥 **Learning**: Advanced React patterns and performance optimization
- 🌱 **Exploring**: New terminal productivity tools and development workflows
- 🤝 **Building**: Side projects to showcase creative coding techniques
- 📚 **Studying**: System design and architecture patterns for scalable apps
- 🎨 **Creating**: Beautiful and functional user interfaces

## 🌟 Life Goals

- 👥 **Community Building**: Create a study and software development community
- 📚 **Writing**: Write a book unrelated to programming, focused on literature
- 🌍 **Language Learning**: Learn to speak English fluently to connect with more people and get better job opportunities
- 🎓 **Education**: Start a Software Engineering degree (Bachelor's Degree)

## ⛏️ Tech Stack Goals 

- 🚀 **Learn Astro**: Astro is considered one of the most prominent JavaScript frameworks, and I intend to study it in the near future to enhance my development skills.
- ☕ **Learn Java**: Actually, Java was the first programming language in which I wrote my first "Hello World" (not easy) and I wanted to reconcile with it and learn it.
- 🚄 **Learn Fast API**: It's one of the best frameworks for building solid backends (also built by a Colombian), so I'd like to learn it and apply it to projects.
